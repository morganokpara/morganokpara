### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Masters student in the [Host Microbe Interactions MSc program](https://hosmic.uth.gr), at the [Microbial Communities and Habitats in Aquatic  Environments Laboratory (MiCHAEL)](https://sites.google.com/site/kkormas) University of Thesssaly, Greece. 

Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics, I studied bovine gut microbial composition and structure, and metabolite variation during pregnancy and lacation as my MSc project. 

I am interested in using novel computational, statistical and machine learning as well as high-throughput genomic approaches to understand **how**:
- Hosts (particularly human and animals) interact with their microbial communities.
- Host-microbe interactions affect disease.
- Symbiosis between host and their microbiome evolved.
- Microbiome influences pathogen virulence and antibiotic resistance.
  
I’m always open to discussing science and exploring collaboration opportunities. Feel free to contact me via email: [Email](morganokpara@gmail.com)
