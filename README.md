-  I am a Masters student in the [Host Microbe Interactions MSc program](https://hosmic.uth.gr), at the [Microbial Communities and Habitats in Aquatic  Environments Laboratory (MiCHAEL)](https://sites.google.com/site/kkormas) University of Thessaly, Greece. 
-  Interested in using novel computational, statistical and machine learning as well as high-throughput genomic approaches to understand microbiome dynamics.
-  Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics, I studied bovine gut microbial composition and structure, and metabolite variation during pregnancy and lactation as my MSc project. 
-  Iâ€™m always open to discussing science and exploring collaboration opportunities. Feel free to contact me via email: [Email](morganokpara@gmail.com)
